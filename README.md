In JavaScript, scope refers to the context or environment in which variables are declared and accessed. It determines the visibility and lifetime of a variable, dictating where in your code a particular variable is valid and accessible1. Here are the key types of scope:

Block Scope: Introduced in ES6, block scope is provided by the let and const keywords. Variables declared inside a { } block are only accessible within that block. For example:

.Global scope; The defalt scope  for all code runing in script mode.
